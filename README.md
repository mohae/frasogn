frasogn
=======

frásögn: a cross-platform archive tool written in go. Frasogn creates a 
compressed file from a source path. This path may be either a file or a
directory. Frasogn will also make compressed tarballs, or encrypted version of
either. 

The resulting output can be either written to a file or to a remote location.

None of this is an actuality at the moment.
